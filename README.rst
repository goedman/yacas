Yacas (Yet Another Computer Algebra System) is a small and highly flexible
general-purpose Computer Algebra System (CAS). The syntax uses an
infix-operator grammar parser. The distribution contains a small library
of mathematical functions, but its real strength is in the language in which
you can easily write your own symbolic manipulation algorithms. The core engine
supports arbitrary precision arithmetic and is able to execute symbolic
manipulations on various mathematical objects by following user-defined rules.  
For detailed information on yacas features and usage, see 
`<http://www.yacas.org>`_.

Yacas is available for a variety of platforms. See 
`<http://www.yacas.org/getting_started/downloads/>`_ for binary packages
and installation instructions. Read INSTALL or
`<https://yacas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html>`_ for 
instructions on how to compile yacas from sources.

Yacas is distributed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2.1 or, at
your discretion, any later version.
