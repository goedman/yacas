Synopsis

yacas [*OPTION*] [*FILE*]

yacas **-i** *COMMAND*

Description
===========

Yacas is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a program for
symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. It uses its own programming
language designed for symbolic as well as arbitrary-precision numerical
computations. The system has a library of scripts that implement many of the
symbolic algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily added to the library.
Yacas comes with extensive documentation covering the scripting language, the
functionality that is already implemented in the system, and the algorithms we
used.
